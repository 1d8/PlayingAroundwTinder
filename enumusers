# Enumerating Before Swiping
This method is a way to see who's in your Tinder "time-line(?)" (for lack of a better term) before they even appear, this will gather their images, their birth year, their bio, and their Tinder ID number (as of now, I don't think the ID number is very useful)

* Open up the dev console
* Refresh the page (make sure you're on the main page before refreshing)
* Navigate to the **core?locale=en** object:

* Copy the JSON output, paste it in your fav text edito
* Congrats!

As we can see, we are hit with their ID, name, the year they were born (the date & the month remain the same for all users for some reason), as well as all their photos they have on their profile!

And here are the links to all the user's images in their profile:
